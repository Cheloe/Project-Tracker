# Project-Tracker

## Here's what I did: 

<li> Linked <a href = "https://days.JS">days.js</a> date/time to page header
<li> Added event listeners to all elements with the button class
<li> Seriously refined my event listener function
<li> Wrote logic that saves any text entered to local storage when corresponding save button is clicked
<li> Added logic that compares each time block's label to the current time (as provided by <a href = "https://days.JS">days.js</a>) and changes class to past/present/future accordingly
<li> Added logic to write from local storage any saved text to corresponding text area
<li> Wrote this readme
<li> Deployed Site
